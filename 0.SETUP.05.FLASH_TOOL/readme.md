# Flash tool /!\ HARDWARE REQUIRED /!\
First of all, there is a lot of tool to flash your device.
Of course you can use the tool you want because it won't be relevant
in any part of the project.
Just remember that flashing require hardware and software.
Make sure you use a compatible duo.

## Software flash tool
On the software part, I use openOCD to flash my microcontroller.

### Why use OpenOCD ?
It's free and powerful.
It's a widely used and reliable tool.
It is easy to use and cover a large palette of device.
You can use JTAG ore SWD or any protocol to debug your microcontroller.

## Hardware flashing tool
For this project I use an STM32F303 discovery kit.
This discovery kit is delivered with an in board st-link interface.
Again, you can chose any tool you like.
If you are working on STM32 you will likely use a st-linkv3.
