@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DAC1 to output on DAC1_OUT1 sampled
values of ADC1 channel7.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC1 channel7 (PC1).
The End Of Conversion (EOC) interrupt is enabled and the conversion is triggered by software.

The DAC1 channel 1 is configured with output buffer disabled.

Each time the end of conversion interrupt occurs, converted value by ADC1 is written
in DAC1 channel 1 register.
Thus applied voltage on ADC1 channel7 (PC1) is output on DAC1_OUT1 (PA4).

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC and STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - RV2 potentiometer is used as connected to ADC1 Channel7.
    - Make sure that the jumper JP11 and JP12 is fitted.
    - Make sure that the jumper JP15 and JP17 are fitted in 3V3 position.
    - Connect PA4 (DAC1_OUT1) pin to an oscilloscope.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
