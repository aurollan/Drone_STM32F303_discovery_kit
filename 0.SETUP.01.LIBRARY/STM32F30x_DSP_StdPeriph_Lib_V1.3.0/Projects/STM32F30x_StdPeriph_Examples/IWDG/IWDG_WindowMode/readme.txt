@par Example Description 

This example shows how to update at regular period the IWDG reload counter and 
how to simulate a software fault generating an MCU IWDG reset on expiry of a 
programmed time period using Window mode.

The IWDG reload and window values are set respectively to 2000 and 1000.
In this case the refresh window is: 
  (2000-1000) / (LSI/16) = ~400 ms < refresh window < 2000 / (LSI/16) = ~800 ms
   
@note the refresh window may varies due to LSI frequency dispersion 

The IWDG counter is refreshed each 750 ms in the main program infinite loop to 
prevent a IWDG reset.

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
occurs, by pressing the Key push-button,LED1 On, the corresponding interrupt is served.
If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the main program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset,LED2 toggles.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1 and LED2.
    - Use Key push button connected to PE.06.
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following files to the project source list
   - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
