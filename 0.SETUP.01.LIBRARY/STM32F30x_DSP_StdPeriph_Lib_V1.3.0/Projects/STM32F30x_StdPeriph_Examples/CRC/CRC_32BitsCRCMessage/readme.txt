@par Example Description 

This example aims to show how to use the CRC peripheral in order to compute
32-bit CRC checksum of a message.
The CRC peripheral is configured to use the 32-bit CRC polynomial
X32 + X26 + X23 + X22 + X16 + X12 + X11 + X10 +X8 + X7 + X5 + X4 + X2+ X +1 
with the initialization value is set to 0.
The message is declared as an array and labeled "CRCBuffer".
Once the CRC value is computed, the computed CRC value is compared to the expected
one. In case of match the green led LD1 is turned on. Otherwise the led LD3 is turned on.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC and STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - LD1 and LD3 are used in this example.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following files to the project source list
   - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
