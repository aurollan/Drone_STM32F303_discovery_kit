@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the FMC firmware library and
an associated driver to perform read/write operations on the IS61WV51216BLL SRAM
memory mounted on STM3210E-EVAL board.

In this example, the SRAM device is configured and initialized explicitly 
following all initialization sequence steps. After initializing the device, user 
can perform read/write operations on it. A data buffer is written to the SRAM 
memory, then read back and checked to verify its correctness.
  
If the data is read correctly from SRAM, the LED1 is ON, otherwise the LED2 is ON.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
      
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL evaluation board 
    on which an STM32F303xE is mounted and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Choose STM32F303xE project
 - Add "stm32f30x_fmc_sram.c" file
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
