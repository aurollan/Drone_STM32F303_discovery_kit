# Build tool
I use Makefile to build my project.
If you use Linux you should know this tools.

## Why choose this tool ?
I'm familiar with this tool, I find it easy to configure.
This tool is widely used and reliable.

## There is no makefile in the repository !
There is no makefile in the main repository because I made a specific one for 
each step. They are all independent.

## Tips
If you want to extract a `compile_commands.json` from a makefile you can
use `bear`.
